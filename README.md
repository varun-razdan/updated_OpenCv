Hi,
I have deleted that .sh file and added a patch of code in filters.py file. Now it will easily work in windows platform. 

Steps for that:-
1) Download Python 2.7.15 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/
2) After installing python open CMD and in cmd type the following 2 commands for installing OpenCV & urllib3 package.
a) pip install opencv-python 
b) pip install urllib3
3) Finally now right click the filters.py file and open through python editor. And Run using F5 button.

Attached is the updated code for reference.
